              we offer affordable and competitive pricing for our Building
              Energy Rating assessments. Our pricing structure is based on the
              size of the property, with larger properties generally costing
              more to assess.

              For example, a one-bedroom apartment will typically cost between

              and €325. However, please note that these prices are approximate
